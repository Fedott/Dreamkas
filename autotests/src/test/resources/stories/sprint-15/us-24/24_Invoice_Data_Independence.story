Narrative:
As заведующим отделом,
I want to чтобы данные в накладной не изменялись при редактировании коммерческой службой товаров
In order to иметь возможность работать с оригинальной версией документа

Scenario: Invoice data independence
Given there is the invoice 'Invoice-DI-Test' with product 'Invoice-DI-Test name' name, 'Invoice-DI-Test sku' sku, 'Invoice-DI-Test barcode' barcode, 'kg' units
And the user navigates to the product with sku 'Invoice-DI-Test sku'
And the user logs in as 'commercialManager'
When the user clicks the edit button on product card view page
And the user inputs values in element fields
| elementName | value |
| name | Invoice-DI-Test name edited |
| barcode | Invoice-DI-Test barcode edited |
| sku | Invoice-DI-Test sku edited |
And the user clicks the create button
Then the user checks the stored input values
When the user logs out
Given the user navigates to the invoice page with name 'Invoice-DI-Test'
And the user logs in as 'departmentManager'
